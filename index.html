                Known for his dazzling charm, rapier wit, and unrivaled humility,
                Michael is the creator of the
                <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails
                    Tutorial</a> and principal author of the
                <a href="https://learnenough.com/">
                    Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a> introductory sequence. Michael
                is also notorious as the founder of
                <a href="https://tauday.com/">Tau Day</a> and author of
                <a href="https://tauday.com/tau-manifesto"><em>The Tau
                    Manifesto</em></a>, but rumors that he's secretly a supervillain
                are slightly exaggerated.

                When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes on

                interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the
                interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

                You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy

                heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a tour
                bus as he is from his kitchen table.
